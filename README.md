Assignment: The Digital Voter Eligibility Checker
Objective
Create a JavaScript program that determines if a person is allowed to participate in a national election based on two specific criteria: Age and Nationality.

The Requirements
Your program should store two pieces of information in variables:

age (a number)

isCitizen (a boolean: true or false)

The Logic
A person is eligible to vote only if:

They are 18 years old or older.

AND they are a citizen of the country (isCitizen is true).

If they meet both requirements, print: "You are eligible to vote!" If they do not meet one or both requirements, print: "You are not eligible to vote."
