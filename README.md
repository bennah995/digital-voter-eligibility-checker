# Digital Voter Eligibility Checker
A streamlined JavaScript program that validates voter eligibility by checking age and citizenship status.

## 📋 Project Overview
This tool automates the decision-making process for election officials by evaluating two key criteria. It ensures that only those who meet the legal threshold are cleared to vote.

## 💻 The Code
The script uses conditional logic to evaluate the variables.

## 🧠 Logic Breakdown
The program checks the following truth table to determine the output:


### Technical Requirements
JavaScript Variables: Using let for flexible data storage.Comparison Operators: Checking if $age \ge 18$.Logical Operators: Using && to ensure both conditions are true.
